The proposed solution offers an automated approach to identifying and managing orphaned Persistent Volumes (PVs) in Kubernetes clusters, particularly in environments leveraging NAS/NFS-backed storage. The system begins by generating a unique identity for each PV through hashing and vectorizing techniques based on metadata like claim name, UID, and namespace. These identity vectors are stored within a structured q-matrix, enabling efficient lookup and pattern recognition. This setup lays the foundation for advanced analytics and decision-making around PV lifecycle management.

A quantum-based voting module processes the q-matrix to classify PVs based on their data sensitivity—ranging from critical (customer or stateful data) to low (ephemeral or test data). This module also assigns a dynamic risk score to each PV by evaluating factors such as binding state, last access time, absence of owner references, and anomaly trends over time. These scores indicate the likelihood that a PV may become orphaned. The enriched metadata is then forwarded to a chaos engineering layer that simulates real-world failure scenarios like pod crashes, PVC deletions, and node failures to validate and fine-tune the orphan detection mechanism.

At the core of real-time monitoring and response is the Dynamic NAS Adaptor (DNA)—a Kubernetes-integrated control plane component designed to continuously track PV states and interactions with the NAS/NFS layer. In addition to real-time monitoring, DNA includes a hypothesis formulation engine that uses the risk score, PV lifecycle patterns, and historical chaos simulation data to generate predictive hypotheses for each PV. For example, if a PV is in a Released state for an unusually long time and has no active claim or associated pod, DNA may hypothesize that the PV will become orphaned within a specific time window. These hypotheses are validated over time and used to improve accuracy, creating a feedback loop that strengthens future predictions.

Upon confirming or detecting a high-probability orphaning scenario, DNA can take automated or semi-automated actions such as triggering admin alerts, recommending PVC reattachments, performing snapshots. For high-sensitivity PVs, DNA can generate audit trails to comply with data retention policies. With this end-to-end framework, the solution bridges the gap between storage intelligence, Kubernetes orchestration, and admin oversight, helping teams maintain data integrity and optimize resource utilization.
